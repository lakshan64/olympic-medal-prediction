# 🏅 Olympic Medal Prediction with Linear Regression

This project uses **linear regression** to predict the number of medals a country will win in the Olympics based on the number of athletes and historical performance. The goal is to explore how basic machine learning techniques can provide insights into team performance and forecast outcomes.

## 📊 Overview

The dataset (`teams.csv`) contains data on Olympic teams, including:
- Country
- Year
- Number of athletes
- Average age
- Medals won
- Previous medal count

We:
- Visualize trends (e.g., athletes vs medals)
- Clean and preprocess the data
- Train a regression model using historical data
- Evaluate model performance
- Analyze prediction errors by team

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (optional for extended visualization)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
